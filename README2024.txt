##Organised Planner

Task:

Was to create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. 
This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

##Installation

I kept the UI/UX simple and sleek to satisfy the users comfortability and web use.
I installed the necessary components needed for this challenge.
The JS functions may not appear on the console, however I have featured an alternative method to replicate the desired outcome.

##Usage

Github Link:

Download the starter code given on bootcamp spot.
Create a professional README file so that others can review your work and complete the challenge(to the best of their ability).
Create a repository for the project on Github, clone the repo if you need to.
Make sure the repo has a license and a README.txt
Click on 'settings' then 'pages' then on the branch section select 'root' then save.
Click on the 'Action' icon on the top bar of the repository.
Deploy/Launch your project.
Follow the progress of your work this way, re-run the job until the final outcome is what you have created.
